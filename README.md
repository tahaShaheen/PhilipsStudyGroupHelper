# PhilipsStudyGroupHelper

In the summer of 2016 I interned at Philips Lighting Pakistan. 

To get that internship I had to go through what they call a study group where they give you a bunch of cardsheets and markers and ask you to prepare presentations is teams about *insert marketing and economics mumbo jumbo in here*. I had zero clue what they wanted from me so I just talked about PCBs.
When I got back home I made this app for anyone like me who needed to come up with random marketing and economics mumbo jumbo on the fly.
